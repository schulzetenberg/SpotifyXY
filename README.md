# SpotifyXY

I find myself saying "I wish Spotify could do X or Y" frequently. This is a app to solve some of those issues.

### Application
SpotifyXY is a modern cross platform desktop app built using [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron).

### UI

The UI is built using [electron forge](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge) with [angular 5 (CLI 1.7.1)](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/releases/tag/v1.7.1) & [angular material](https://github.com/angular/material2).

$ yarn
```
